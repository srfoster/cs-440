# Module 1: Intelligent Agents and Search

This module introduces the fundamental concepts of intelligent agents and explores various search algorithms that enable agents to find solutions in problem spaces.

## Topics Covered

### Intelligent Agents
- What makes an agent rational?
- Different types of agent architectures
- Performance measures and environment types

### Uninformed Search Strategies
- Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Depth-First Search (DFS)
- Uniform Cost Search (UCS)
- Maze navigation problems

### Informed Search Strategies
- Heuristic functions
- A* Search
- Greedy Best-First Search
- Admissibility and consistency

## Practice Questions

Work through the practice questions in this module to test your understanding of intelligent agents and search algorithms.
