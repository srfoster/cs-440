  **Solve the 8-puzzle problem by formulating it as a search problem.**

  **Level 0** Discuss the significance of state space formulation in AI and how it applies to the problem.  What is the benefit of formulating a problem as a search problem?  What are the key components of a search problem? 

  **Level 1** Describe the state space, actions, and goal test for the 8-puzzle problem.  Demonstrate a BFS search of the state space by drawing part of the search tree.  
  
  **Level 2** Implement a solution to the 8-puzzle problem in a language of your choice by using A* search. (HINT: Use Manhattan distance as your heuristic)

  **Level 3** Formally analyze the time and space complexity of various search algorithms (BFS, DFS with iterative deepening, and A*).
  Discuss the impact of heuristic choice on A* search performance and optimality. Provide examples of admissible heuristics for the 8-puzzle problem.

answer: "The 8-puzzle requires three key functions: ACTIONS(s) returns valid moves based on the blank tile's position (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT within grid bounds), RESULT(s,a) creates a new state by swapping the blank with an adjacent tile, and GOAL_TEST(s) checks if the state matches the goal configuration [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,0]]. This formulation enables any search algorithm to solve the puzzle.  The 8-puzzle exemplifies state-space search problem formulation. The state space consists of all possible 3×3 configurations with tiles {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, though only 9!/2 = 181,440 states are reachable from any given initial state due to parity constraints. ACTIONS(s): Θ(1) operation computing valid moves from blank position. RESULT(s,a): Θ(n²) for grid copying, though optimizable with persistent data structures. GOAL_TEST(s): Θ(n²) equality check. The formulation's key insight is that by abstracting the problem into these three functions plus a cost function (uniform cost = 1 per move), we can apply any search algorithm (BFS, A*, IDA*, etc.) without modifying the search code itself."
