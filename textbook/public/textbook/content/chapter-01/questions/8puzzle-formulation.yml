question: |
  **Write the problem formulation functions for the 8-puzzle problem.**
  
  **Level 0** Discuss the big-picture significance of problem formulation in AI. Why is it important to formally define states, actions, and goals?
  
  **Level 1** Explain the 8-puzzle problem intuitively. Describe how to represent the state as a 3×3 grid, what actions are available, and how to test if we've reached the goal. Give pseudocode for ACTIONS(s), RESULT(s,a), and GOAL_TEST(s).
  
  **Level 2** Implement the three functions in a language of your choice. Your implementation should handle a state represented as a 3×3 grid where 0 represents the blank tile.
  
  **Level 3** Analyze the state space size for the 8-puzzle. Discuss reachability (not all 9!/2 states are reachable from a given start) and the complexity implications for search algorithms.
answer: "The 8-puzzle requires three key functions: ACTIONS(s) returns valid moves based on the blank tile's position (UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT within grid bounds), RESULT(s,a) creates a new state by swapping the blank with an adjacent tile, and GOAL_TEST(s) checks if the state matches the goal configuration [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,0]]. This formulation enables any search algorithm to solve the puzzle."
answer_kindergarten: "The 8-puzzle is like a sliding tile game. You have 8 numbered tiles and one empty space in a small square. You can slide tiles into the empty space. We need to tell the computer: which tiles can move right now, what happens when we move a tile, and when we've won the game by getting all the tiles in the right order."
answer_3rd_grade: "To solve the 8-puzzle with a computer, we need three special instructions: 1) Check which way the empty space can move (up, down, left, or right, but not off the board), 2) Make a new puzzle by sliding a tile into the empty space, and 3) Check if all the numbers are in order from 1 to 8 with the empty space at the bottom right."
answer_7th_grade: "The 8-puzzle problem formulation uses three functions. ACTIONS(s) finds where the blank (0) is located and returns which directions it can move without going outside the 3×3 grid. RESULT(s,a) creates a copy of the state, finds the blank, and swaps it with the neighboring tile in the specified direction. GOAL_TEST(s) compares the current state with the goal state [[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[7,8,0]]. These functions provide everything a search algorithm needs to find a solution."
answer_high_school: "Problem formulation in the 8-puzzle requires precise function definitions. ACTIONS(s) locates the blank tile at position (r,c) and returns a list of valid moves: 'UP' if r>0, 'DOWN' if r<2, 'LEFT' if c>0, 'RIGHT' if c<2. RESULT(s,a) performs a deep copy of state s, calculates the new blank position based on action a, swaps the blank with the target tile, and returns the new state. GOAL_TEST(s) performs an equality check against the canonical goal configuration. This abstraction allows separation of problem definition from search strategy."
answer_undergraduate: "The 8-puzzle exemplifies state-space search problem formulation. The state space consists of all possible 3×3 configurations with tiles {0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8}, though only 9!/2 = 181,440 states are reachable from any given initial state due to parity constraints. ACTIONS(s): Θ(1) operation computing valid moves from blank position. RESULT(s,a): Θ(n²) for grid copying, though optimizable with persistent data structures. GOAL_TEST(s): Θ(n²) equality check. The formulation's key insight is that by abstracting the problem into these three functions plus a cost function (uniform cost = 1 per move), we can apply any search algorithm (BFS, A*, IDA*, etc.) without modifying the search code itself."
