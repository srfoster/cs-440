question: |
  **Solve the 8-Queens problem using hill climbing optimization.**

  **Level 0** Discuss greedy local search and its limitations. Why do local minima, plateaus, and ridges pose problems? What makes hill climbing "greedy"?

  **Level 1** Using the 8-Queens formulation and CONFLICTS function from the previous question, describe the hill climbing algorithm. What defines a "neighbor" state? Give pseudocode for HILL_CLIMB(board) that moves to the best neighbor until no improvement is possible. Demonstrate by hand on a sample board.

  **Level 2** Implement hill climbing for 8-Queens. Include neighbor generation (moving each queen to each row in its column) and the greedy selection step. Run multiple random restarts and report success rate.

  **Level 3** Analyze the completeness and optimality of hill climbing. For 8-Queens, estimate the success rate from random starting positions (~86%). Discuss strategies to escape local optima: random restart, sideways moves, random walk. Compare time complexity O(n² × restarts) vs. backtracking O(n!).
answer: "Hill climbing for 8-Queens uses a state representation where board[col]=row indicates queen positions. CONFLICTS counts pairs of queens attacking each other (same row or diagonal). The algorithm iteratively examines all neighbors (moving one queen in its column), selects the neighbor with fewest conflicts, and repeats until no improvement is possible. It's incomplete due to local optima but very fast when it succeeds."
answer_kindergarten: "The 8-Queens problem is like trying to place 8 chess queens on a chessboard so none of them can capture each other. Hill climbing tries moving one queen at a time to a better spot, always picking the move that causes the fewest fights between queens. Sometimes it gets stuck because every move looks worse, even though there's a better solution if you keep trying."
answer_3rd_grade: "In the 8-Queens puzzle, you need to place 8 queens on a chess board so no two queens can attack each other. We represent this by saying which row each queen is in for each column (like board[3]=5 means the queen in column 3 is in row 5). To solve it, we count how many queen-pairs are attacking (conflicts), then try moving each queen up or down in its column. We pick the move that reduces conflicts the most and keep going until we can't improve anymore."
answer_7th_grade: "Hill climbing for 8-Queens starts with a random placement. CONFLICTS(board) counts attacking queen pairs by checking if board[i]==board[j] (same row) or abs(board[i]-board[j])==abs(i-j) (same diagonal) for all pairs. The algorithm generates all neighbors by trying each possible row for each column, evaluates conflicts for each neighbor, and moves to the best one. It stops when the current state has fewer conflicts than all neighbors (local optimum). Random restarts help escape local optima."
answer_high_school: "State representation: board[0..7] where board[col]=row. Objective: minimize CONFLICTS(board) = number of attacking queen pairs. Algorithm: (1) Start with random board. (2) Generate all neighbors by moving each queen to each possible row in its column (7×8=56 neighbors). (3) Evaluate conflicts for each. (4) Move to best neighbor if better than current. (5) Repeat until no improvement. Complexity: O(n³) per iteration for n-Queens (n columns × n rows × O(n) conflict check). Gets stuck in local optima ~14% of the time for 8-Queens. Solutions: random restart (repeat with new random start), simulated annealing (accept worse moves probabilistically), or sideways moves (continue when plateau)."
answer_undergraduate: "Hill climbing is a local search algorithm navigating the complete-state formulation space. For N-Queens: State space size O(n^n), but gradient descent via steepest-ascent hill climbing evaluates O(n²) neighbors per step. CONFLICTS objective: O(n²) time via explicit pair enumeration, optimizable to O(n) with auxiliary data structures tracking attacks per row/diagonal. Completeness: No - guaranteed to reach local optimum, not global. Optimality: No - solution quality depends on topology of state-space landscape. For 8-Queens, ~86% success rate from random starts. Variants: Stochastic hill climbing (random among improving moves), first-choice (accept first improvement), random-restart (multiple independent runs). Theoretical analysis: Expected number of restarts = 1/p where p is basin of attraction for global optima. N-Queens has many global optima (92 solutions for N=8, with symmetries), increasing success probability. Local search trades completeness for speed: O(n² × restarts) vs. O(n!) for backtracking, highly effective for large N where systematic search is infeasible."
