  **Implement the A-star search algorithm -- A_STAR(start, h) -- for maze navigation.**

  **Level 0** Discuss the significance of search in the context of AI.  Discuss how A* search (informed search) differs from algorithms like BFS and DFS (uninformed search).

  **Level 1** For a sample maze, demonstrate A* search showing the priority queue and distance updates.  Give pseudocode.

  **Level 2** Implement A* search in a language of your choice, including path reconstruction.

  **Level 3** Analyze the time and space complexity of A* search. Explain how the choice of heuristic h affects performance and optimality. Discuss admissible heuristics and give examples.
answer: "A* search uses f(n) = g(n) + h(n) where g(n) is the actual cost from start to n and h(n) is the estimated cost from n to goal. It maintains a priority queue (open list) ordered by f-value. A* is optimal when h is admissible (never overestimates). Better heuristics (higher h while staying admissible) explore fewer nodes. Manhattan distance is a classic admissible heuristic for grid-based problems.\n\nA* optimally solves shortest-path problems when h is admissible. Proof of optimality: Suppose suboptimal goal G2 with f(G2) < f(G1) where G1 is optimal. Let n be an unexpanded node on optimal path to G1. Then f(n) = g(n) + h(n) ≤ g(n) + h*(n) = f*(n) = C* (optimal cost). But f(G2) = g(G2) > C*, contradicting f(G2) < f(G1) = C*. Time/space: O(b^d) in worst case, but effective branching factor depends on h accuracy. A* with consistent h expands nodes in order of increasing g-value, equivalent to Dijkstra's on an implicit graph. Heuristic quality measured by effective branching factor b*: N = 1 + b* + (b*)^2 + ... + (b*)^d where N is nodes expanded. Well-designed heuristics can reduce b* dramatically. Pattern databases, linear conflict, and disjoint pattern additivity are advanced techniques for creating powerful admissible heuristics."
