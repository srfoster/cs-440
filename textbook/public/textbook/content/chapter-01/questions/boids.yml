question: |
  A multi-agent system is a system composed of multiple interacting agents whose collective behavior may be complex even if each agent's rules are simple. The boids model is a classic example: each boid updates its velocity based on local neighbors using three intuitive rules—separation (avoid crowding), alignment (match heading), and cohesion (move toward neighbors). This matters because it shows a key AI theme: intelligent-seeming global behavior can emerge from decentralized local rules, and it contrasts sharply with search-based AI.
  
  **Task:** Write pseudocode for a function STEP_BOIDS(boids, params) that computes one synchronous update step (all boids updated based on the old configuration), applying weighted separation/alignment/cohesion forces and a speed cap.
answer: |
  Boids algorithm simulates flocking behavior using three rules: separation (avoid crowding), alignment (steer toward average heading), and cohesion (steer toward average position). Each boid computes forces from neighbors within a radius, combines them with weights, and updates velocity and position.
  
  Pseudocode:
  ```
  function STEP_BOIDS(boids, params):
      newBoids = []
      for i in 0..len(boids)-1:
          b = boids[i]
          neighbors = NEIGHBORS(boids, i, params.radius)
          
          sep = vector(0,0)
          ali = vector(0,0)
          coh = vector(0,0)
          
          for j in neighbors:
              diff = b.pos - boids[j].pos
              sep += normalize(diff) / (epsilon + norm(diff))
              ali += boids[j].vel
              coh += boids[j].pos
          
          if len(neighbors) > 0:
              ali = (ali / len(neighbors)) - b.vel
              coh = (coh / len(neighbors)) - b.pos
          
          accel = params.wSep*sep + params.wAli*ali + params.wCoh*coh
          v2 = limit(b.vel + accel, params.maxSpeed)
          p2 = b.pos + v2
          newBoids.append( (p2, v2) )
      return newBoids
  ```
