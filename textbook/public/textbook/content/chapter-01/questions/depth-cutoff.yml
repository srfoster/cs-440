question: |
  A depth-limited search is a variant of DFS that explores paths only up to a maximum depth. A cutoff is used when deeper search becomes too expensive, when we only care about short solutions, or when we want a controlled approximation of DFS (and as a building block for IDDFS). This matters because real AI systems often cannot afford unlimited search; they must manage computation using resource bounds while still behaving sensibly.
  
  **Task:** Write pseudocode for DFS_CUTOFF(start, cutoff) that performs DFS but stops expanding nodes beyond the depth limit. The function should return a solution path if found within the cutoff depth, and failure otherwise.
answer: |
  DFS_CUTOFF performs depth-limited search by calling the DLS (depth-limited search) helper function with a specified cutoff depth. If the goal is not found within that depth, it returns failure.
  
  Pseudocode:
  ```
  function DFS_CUTOFF(start, cutoff):
      parent = map()
      parent[start] = null
      found = DLS(start, cutoff, parent)
      if found == failure: return failure
      return RECONSTRUCT_PATH(parent, found)
  ```
