question: |
  **Implement depth-limited DFS (DFS with cutoff).**
  
  Write DFS_CUTOFF(start, cutoff) that returns failure if not found within depth.
answer: |
  DFS_CUTOFF performs depth-limited search by calling the DLS (depth-limited search) helper function with a specified cutoff depth. If the goal is not found within that depth, it returns failure.
  
  Pseudocode:
  ```
  function DFS_CUTOFF(start, cutoff):
      parent = map()
      parent[start] = null
      found = DLS(start, cutoff, parent)
      if found == failure: return failure
      return RECONSTRUCT_PATH(parent, found)
  ```
