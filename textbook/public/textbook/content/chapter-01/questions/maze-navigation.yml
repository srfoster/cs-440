question: |
  **Write an algorithm to navigate a maze from a start position to a goal position.**
  
  **Level 0** Discuss the big-picture significance of maze navigation in the context of artificial intelligence and real-world problem solving.
  
  **Level 1** Discuss the intuition behind maze navigation by describing the problem representation (how to represent the maze and positions), relevant data structures, and give pseudocode for one or more search algorithms that can solve this problem. Step through your algorithm with a simple example.
  
  **Level 2** Implement your algorithm(s) in a language of your choice. Your implementation should handle a maze represented as a 2D grid where walls are obstacles and the agent must find a path from start to goal.
  
  **Level 3** Analyze the space and time complexity of your algorithm(s). Compare different search strategies (BFS, DFS, A*) for maze navigation. Discuss when each approach is most appropriate and re-contextualize maze navigation in terms of broader AI search problems.
answer: "Maze navigation can be solved using graph search algorithms. The maze is represented as a graph where each cell is a node and edges connect adjacent passable cells. Breadth-First Search (BFS) guarantees finding the shortest path by exploring all positions at distance k before exploring positions at distance k+1. The algorithm uses a queue to track positions to explore and a visited set to avoid cycles."
answer_kindergarten: "To get through a maze, you can try going in different directions from where you start. If you hit a wall, you go back and try a different way. You keep trying until you find the exit. It's like when you're in a corn maze and you remember where you've already been so you don't get lost in circles."
answer_3rd_grade: "Maze navigation is like being a robot that needs to find its way from one place to another without bumping into walls. The robot remembers where it's been and tries different paths. One good way is to check all nearby spots first, then check spots a bit further away, until you find the goal. This is called Breadth-First Search."
answer_7th_grade: "To navigate a maze, we represent it as a grid where each cell can be either a wall or a passable space. Using Breadth-First Search, we start at the beginning position and explore all adjacent cells (up, down, left, right). We keep track of visited cells and use a queue to process cells in the order we discover them. This guarantees we'll find the shortest path if one exists."
answer_high_school: "Maze navigation is a classic graph search problem. The maze is modeled as a graph G=(V,E) where vertices are passable cells and edges connect adjacent cells. BFS explores the graph level by level using a FIFO queue, guaranteeing optimal path length. DFS uses a stack (or recursion) and may find a path faster but doesn't guarantee optimality. A* search improves on BFS by using heuristics (like Manhattan distance) to guide the search toward the goal more efficiently."
answer_undergraduate: "Maze navigation exemplifies state-space search in AI. The problem can be formalized as a tuple (S, s₀, A, T, G) where S is the state space (all cells), s₀ is the start state, A are actions (move up/down/left/right), T is the transition function, and G is the goal set. BFS achieves O(|V|+|E|) time complexity and guarantees completeness and optimality for uniform cost. A* search with an admissible heuristic h(n) (h(n) ≤ h*(n)) maintains optimality while potentially reducing the search space significantly. The choice of algorithm depends on the problem characteristics: BFS for guaranteed shortest path, DFS for memory-constrained scenarios, and A* for large state spaces with good heuristics."
