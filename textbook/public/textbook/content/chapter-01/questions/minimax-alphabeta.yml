  **Play optimal Connect-4 using Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning.**

  **Level 0** Discuss the shift from single-agent search (8-puzzle) to adversarial search in Connect-4. Why does having an opponent fundamentally change the problem? What makes Connect-4 "zero-sum"? Why is "assume optimal opponent" reasonable here? Compare the ideas of searching for shortest path (8-puzzle) vs searching for a guaranteed win against perfect play.  Why does Connect-4 require evaluation functions rather than solving to terminal states?

  **Level 1** Formalize the State, Actions, Terminal, and Utility for Connect-4.  Demonstrate minimax decision making on a small Connect-4 game tree. Show how the minimax values are computed bottom-up, and how the optimal move is selected at the root.  Then describe how alpha-beta pruning works on the same tree. Show how alpha and beta values are updated, and identify which branches are pruned.
  
  **Level 2** Implement minimax with alpha-beta for Connect-4 with depth limit 6 (look 6 moves ahead). Use evaluation function: count 4-in-a-row threats weighted by how many of your discs are in them. 

  **Level 3** Prove alpha-beta correctness: returns same value as minimax.  Formally, analyze complexity.  

answer: "Minimax computes optimal play by recursively evaluating MAX (maximizer's turn) and MIN (minimizer's turn) layers. Alpha-beta pruning eliminates branches that cannot affect the final decision by maintaining alpha (best MAX option) and beta (best MIN option) bounds. If beta ≤ alpha, remaining siblings can be pruned. Optimal move ordering achieves O(b^(d/2)) vs. O(b^d) for minimax."
