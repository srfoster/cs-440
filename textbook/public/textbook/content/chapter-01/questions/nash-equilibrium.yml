  **Analyze strategic reasoning in the Prisoner's Dilemma and sealed-bid auctions using Nash equilibrium.**

  The Prisoner's Dilemma captures a fundamental tension in cooperation. Two suspects are arrested. Police offer each a deal: (1) If you testify ("defect") and your partner stays silent ("cooperate"), you go free and they get 5 years. (2) If both defect, you each get 3 years. (3) If both cooperate (stay silent), you each get 1 year. (4) If you cooperate and they defect, you get 5 years. What should you do? Defecting is always better for you regardless of what your partner does—yet both defecting (3,3) is worse than both cooperating (1,1). This "rational" outcome that's worse for everyone is the Nash equilibrium. Unlike Connect-4 (zero-sum: your win is my loss), the Prisoner's Dilemma is non-zero-sum: mutual cooperation is better than mutual defection, but individual incentives prevent it.

  **Level 0** Discuss how Nash equilibrium differs from minimax. In Connect-4, "optimal" means "maximize your utility assuming opponent minimizes yours." But in Prisoner's Dilemma, there's no direct opposition—your 3-year sentence isn't my gain. Why is "assume optimal opponent" insufficient? Because "optimal" depends on what you do! Compare: Connect-4 has a single optimal move (found by minimax); Prisoner's Dilemma has a stable strategy profile (Nash equilibrium) where both defect, even though both could do better by cooperating.

  **Level 1** Define Nash equilibrium for the Prisoner's Dilemma. Strategy profile (Defect, Defect) is a Nash equilibrium if: (1) Given partner defects, you can't improve by deviating to Cooperate (3 years < 5 years ✓), (2) Given you defect, partner can't improve by deviating to Cooperate (3 < 5 ✓). Best-response reasoning: if partner cooperates, you choose Defect (0 < 1); if partner defects, you choose Defect (3 < 5). Defect dominates Cooperate.
  
  Payoff matrices: Row player matrix A, column player matrix B. A[i,j] = row's payoff if row plays i and column plays j. For 2×2 games, check each (i,j) strategy pair: is i a best response to j? Is j a best response to i?
  
  Give pseudocode for PURE_NASH_2x2(A, B) that checks all four outcomes. Demonstrate by hand on Prisoner's Dilemma: A=B=[[−1,−5],[0,−3]]. Also test on a sealed-bid auction: two bidders, item worth $100, each bids $0-$100. Payoff if you bid b and opponent bids b': (1) If b>b', you pay b and get $100 (payoff 100−b), (2) If b<b', payoff 0, (3) If b=b', tie (payoff 50−b). Find Nash equilibrium.

  **Level 2** Implement PURE_NASH_2x2(A, B). Test on: (1) Prisoner's Dilemma (one Nash: defect-defect), (2) Sealed-bid auction with discrete bids [50, 60, 70, 80] (what's the Nash?), (3) Matching Pennies: payoffs A=[[1,−1],[−1,1]], B=[[−1,1],[1,−1]] (zero-sum game). Why does Matching Pennies have no pure Nash equilibrium? Introduce mixed strategies: play Cooperate with probability p, Defect with probability 1−p. For Matching Pennies, compute mixed Nash: both play Heads/Tails with p=0.5.

  **Level 3** Prove Nash's existence theorem: every finite game has at least one Nash equilibrium (possibly mixed). For the sealed-bid auction, analyze the continuous case: bidders can bid any real number $0-$100. The unique Nash equilibrium is both bid $100 (payoff 0 each). Why? If you bid <$100, opponent can bid slightly higher and win. Discuss computational complexity: finding Nash equilibria is PPAD-complete (harder than P, but not NP-complete). Compare with minimax in zero-sum games: minimax value exists, Nash equilibrium always exists but may require randomization. Discuss limitations: Prisoner's Dilemma's Nash (defect-defect) is Pareto-dominated by (cooperate-cooperate). How do repeated games, reputation, and multi-agent RL change this?
answer: |
  A pure Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile where no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing strategy. Check each strategy pair (i,j) to see if it's a best response for both players.
  
  Pseudocode:
  ```
  function PURE_NASH_2x2(A, B):
      equilibria = []
      for i in 0..1:          # row action
          for j in 0..1:      # col action
              # is (i,j) best response for row?
              rowBest = true
              for i2 in 0..1:
                  if A[i2][j] > A[i][j]:
                      rowBest = false
              # is (i,j) best response for col?
              colBest = true
              for j2 in 0..1:
                  if B[i][j2] > B[i][j]:
                      colBest = false
              if rowBest and colBest:
                  add (i,j) to equilibria
      return equilibria
