  **Find Nash equilibria in general-sum games beyond zero-sum adversarial search.**

  **Level 0** Discuss how Nash equilibrium generalizes minimax reasoning to non-zero-sum games. Why is "assume optimal opponent" not enough when interests aren't perfectly opposed? What makes Nash equilibrium a "stable" solution concept? Give examples: Prisoner's Dilemma, Battle of the Sexes, Rock-Paper-Scissors.

  **Level 1** Define Nash equilibrium: a strategy profile where no player can improve by unilaterally deviating. Explain best-response reasoning. For 2×2 normal-form games with payoff matrices A (row player) and B (column player), describe how to find pure Nash equilibria by checking if each strategy pair (i,j) is a best response for both players. Give pseudocode for PURE_NASH_2x2(A, B). Demonstrate by hand on Prisoner's Dilemma and Matching Pennies.

  **Level 2** Implement PURE_NASH_2x2 and test on classic games. Explain why some games have no pure Nash equilibrium (Matching Pennies, Rock-Paper-Scissors). Introduce mixed strategies: probability distributions over actions. Compute a mixed Nash equilibrium by hand for a 2×2 game.

  **Level 3** Prove Nash's existence theorem: every finite game has at least one Nash equilibrium (possibly mixed). Discuss computational complexity: finding Nash equilibria is PPAD-complete. Compare Nash equilibrium with minimax value in zero-sum games. Discuss limitations: multiple equilibria, equilibrium selection, irrationality. How do Nash equilibria relate to multi-agent reinforcement learning?
answer: |
  A pure Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile where no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing strategy. Check each strategy pair (i,j) to see if it's a best response for both players.
  
  Pseudocode:
  ```
  function PURE_NASH_2x2(A, B):
      equilibria = []
      for i in 0..1:          # row action
          for j in 0..1:      # col action
              # is (i,j) best response for row?
              rowBest = true
              for i2 in 0..1:
                  if A[i2][j] > A[i][j]:
                      rowBest = false
              # is (i,j) best response for col?
              colBest = true
              for j2 in 0..1:
                  if B[i][j2] > B[i][j]:
                      colBest = false
              if rowBest and colBest:
                  add (i,j) to equilibria
      return equilibria
  ```
