  **Solve the 8-Queens problem using stochastic optimization: simulated annealing and genetic algorithms.**

  **Level 0** Discuss how randomness helps overcome the limitations of greedy hill climbing. Compare two paradigms: single-point stochastic search (simulated annealing) vs. population-based search (genetic algorithms). Why is the exploration-exploitation trade-off central to both?   Discuss the metallurgical annealing metaphor and genetic evolution metaphor for each algorithm.

  **Level 1** Using the 8-Queens formulation:
  
  **Simulated Annealing:**  Demonstrate the use of simulated annealing on a sample board. Show how the acceptance probability changes with temperature and delta. 
  
  **Genetic Algorithm:**  Demonstrate the use of a genetic algorithm on a sample population of boards. Show how selection, crossover, and mutation operate on the population. 

  **Level 2** Implement both algorithms for 8-Queens.

  **Level 3** Analyze theoretical guarantees and practical trade-offs between these algorithms.  When might a problem be better suited for one over the other?  Discuss how the objective function landscape (number of local optima, global optima) affects search difficulty and algorithm choice.
  
answer: "**Simulated annealing** accepts worse moves with probability exp(-delta/T) where temperature T decreases over time (T = alpha * T). This escapes local optima early while converging as T→0. **Genetic algorithms** maintain a population, select parents by fitness, create offspring through crossover and mutation. For 8-Queens: fitness = 1/(1+conflicts), tournament selection picks best of k random, one-point crossover combines board segments, mutation randomly changes positions. Both overcome hill climbing's greedy limitations through controlled randomness."
