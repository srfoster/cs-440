# Module 2: Local Search and Optimization

This module explores local search algorithms that navigate through the space of complete states, improving solutions iteratively rather than building paths from an initial state.

## Topics Covered

### Local Search Fundamentals
- Objective functions and optimization landscapes
- Hill climbing and local optima
- The exploration vs. exploitation trade-off

### Stochastic Methods
- Simulated annealing
- Genetic algorithms
- Random search techniques

### Applications
- N-Queens problem
- Continuous optimization
- Real-world constraint satisfaction

## Practice Questions

Work through the practice questions in this module to understand local search and optimization algorithms.
