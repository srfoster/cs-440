question: |
  In local search, we do not build solution paths; instead we treat problem-solving as optimization. We define an objective function that scores candidate solutions, and we search for a state with a better score. The 8-queens problem can be approached this way by defining an objective like "number of conflicting queen pairs," which we want to minimize. This matters because many real-world problems are naturally "optimize a score" rather than "reach a goal state through a shortest path."
  
  **Task:** Using the representation board[col] = row, write pseudocode for CONFLICTS(board) that returns the number of attacking queen pairs (same row or diagonal).
answer: |
  The CONFLICTS function counts pairs of queens that attack each other either on the same row or the same diagonal. For N-Queens represented as board[col]=row, two queens at positions (i, board[i]) and (j, board[j]) conflict if they're on the same row or same diagonal.
  
  Pseudocode:
  ```
  function CONFLICTS(board):
      n = len(board)
      c = 0
      for i in 0..n-1:
          for j in i+1..n-1:
              sameRow = (board[i] == board[j])
              sameDiag = (abs(board[i]-board[j]) == abs(i-j))
              if sameRow or sameDiag:
                  c += 1
      return c
  ```
