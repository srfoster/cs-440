question: |
  **Formulate the 8-Queens problem as an optimization problem and implement the CONFLICTS objective function.**

  **Level 0** Discuss the difference between path-finding search (Chapter 1) and optimization-based search (Chapter 2). Why is local search appropriate for problems like N-Queens? What are the trade-offs?

  **Level 1** Describe the 8-Queens problem as an optimization problem. Using the representation board[col]=row, explain what constitutes a conflict between queens. Give pseudocode for CONFLICTS(board) that counts attacking queen pairs. Demonstrate by hand on a sample board.

  **Level 2** Implement the CONFLICTS function in a language of your choice. Generate random 8-Queens boards and verify your conflict counting is correct.

  **Level 3** Analyze the time complexity of CONFLICTS(board). Discuss how the objective function landscape affects search: are there many local optima? How does the number of global optima (92 for 8-Queens with symmetries) relate to search difficulty?
answer: |
  The CONFLICTS function counts pairs of queens that attack each other either on the same row or the same diagonal. For N-Queens represented as board[col]=row, two queens at positions (i, board[i]) and (j, board[j]) conflict if they're on the same row or same diagonal.
  
  Pseudocode:
  ```
  function CONFLICTS(board):
      n = len(board)
      c = 0
      for i in 0..n-1:
          for j in i+1..n-1:
              sameRow = (board[i] == board[j])
              sameDiag = (abs(board[i]-board[j]) == abs(i-j))
              if sameRow or sameDiag:
                  c += 1
      return c
  ```
