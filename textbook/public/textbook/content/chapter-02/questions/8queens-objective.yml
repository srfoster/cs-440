question: |
  **Write the objective function CONFLICTS(board) for 8-Queens where board[col]=row.**
  
  Count the number of queen pairs attacking each other.
answer: |
  The CONFLICTS function counts pairs of queens that attack each other either on the same row or the same diagonal. For N-Queens represented as board[col]=row, two queens at positions (i, board[i]) and (j, board[j]) conflict if they're on the same row or same diagonal.
  
  Pseudocode:
  ```
  function CONFLICTS(board):
      n = len(board)
      c = 0
      for i in 0..n-1:
          for j in i+1..n-1:
              sameRow = (board[i] == board[j])
              sameDiag = (abs(board[i]-board[j]) == abs(i-j))
              if sameRow or sameDiag:
                  c += 1
      return c
  ```
