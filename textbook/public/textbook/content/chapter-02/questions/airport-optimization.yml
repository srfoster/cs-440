  **Solve the airport placement problem using continuous optimization.**

  **Level 0** Discuss the difference between discrete optimization (8-Queens) and continuous optimization (airport placement). When is "state space as a graph" not the right model? Why don't discrete search methods work well here?

  **Level 1** Describe the airport placement problem: find (x,y) that minimizes weighted sum of squared distances to towns. Give pseudocode for AIRPORT_OBJECTIVE(x,y,towns) and RANDOM_SEARCH_CONTINUOUS(towns, bounds, iters). Demonstrate by hand with 3 towns.

  **Level 2** Implement both functions. Compare random search with gradient descent (compute partial derivatives ∂f/∂x and ∂f/∂y analytically). Visualize the objective function as a heat map.

  **Level 3** Prove that the optimal solution is the weighted centroid: x* = Σ(w_i * x_i)/Σw_i. Analyze why this problem has a single global optimum (convex function). Discuss how this differs from the 8-Queens landscape. Generalize to other continuous optimization problems: when can we use calculus vs. metaheuristics?

  This is a continuous optimization problem where we want to find the best location for an airport that minimizes weighted distances to multiple towns. Random search samples many random points and keeps the best.
  
  Pseudocode:
  ```
  function AIRPORT_OBJECTIVE(x, y, towns):
      # towns: list of (tx,ty, weight)
      s = 0
      for (tx,ty,w) in towns:
          dx = x - tx; dy = y - ty
          s += w * (dx*dx + dy*dy)
      return s
  
  function RANDOM_SEARCH_CONTINUOUS(towns, bounds, iters):
      best = null
      bestVal = +infinity
      for i in 1..iters:
          x = randomUniform(bounds.xMin, bounds.xMax)
          y = randomUniform(bounds.yMin, bounds.yMax)
          v = AIRPORT_OBJECTIVE(x,y,towns)
          if v < bestVal:
              bestVal = v
              best = (x,y)
      return best
  ```
