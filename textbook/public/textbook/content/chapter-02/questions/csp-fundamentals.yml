  **Formulate and solve Constraint Satisfaction Problems using backtracking search with forward checking.**

  **Level 0** Discuss how CSPs differ from generic search problems (Chapter 1). Why is exploiting constraints more powerful than blind search? What makes problems like Sudoku, map coloring, and scheduling natural as CSPs rather than path-finding? Compare CSP solving (search + inference) with optimization (Chapter 2) and adversarial search (Chapter 3).

  **Level 1** Define CSP components: variables, domains, and constraints. Using map coloring as the running example, give pseudocode for MAKE_MAP_COLORING_CSP(regions, edges, colors). Demonstrate by hand on Australia map.
  
  Then describe backtracking search: assign variables one at a time, check consistency, backtrack on failure. Explain forward checking: after assigning variable X=v, remove inconsistent values from neighbors' domains. Give pseudocode for BACKTRACK(assignment, csp) with forward checking and domain restoration. Demonstrate by hand on a 4-coloring problem.

  **Level 2** Implement CSP representation and backtracking with forward checking for map coloring or Sudoku. Test with and without forward checking to see pruning effectiveness. Implement variable-ordering heuristics: MRV (minimum remaining values), degree heuristic. Implement value-ordering: least-constraining-value.

  **Level 3** Analyze backtracking complexity: worst-case O(d^n) where d=domain size, n=variables. Prove forward checking maintains correctness (doesn't miss solutions). Discuss why heuristics matter: MRV fails first on impossible problems, LCV succeeds first on solvable ones. Compare CSP backtracking with DFS: when is CSP formulation better? Discuss when to use CSP vs. local search (Chapter 2).
answer: "CSP consists of variables (X₁,...,Xₙ), domains (D₁,...,Dₙ), and constraints limiting value combinations. Backtracking assigns variables sequentially, checking consistency. Forward checking prunes neighbor domains after each assignment, detecting failures early. When any domain becomes empty, backtrack. Heuristics: MRV (pick variable with fewest legal values), degree (most constraints), LCV (value constraining fewest neighbors). Complexity: O(d^n) worst-case, much faster with inference and heuristics."
