question: |
  **Implement a genetic algorithm for the 8-Queens problem.**
  
  **Level 0** Discuss how evolution inspires computational search. Why are population-based methods powerful?
  
  **Level 1** Explain genetic algorithm components: population, fitness, selection, crossover, and mutation. Provide pseudocode for the GA loop.
  
  **Level 2** Implement a GA with tournament selection, one-point crossover, and mutation for 8-Queens.
  
  **Level 3** Analyze GA performance: diversity vs. convergence, parameter tuning, and schema theorem basics.
answer: "Genetic algorithms maintain a population of candidate solutions, select parents based on fitness, create offspring through crossover and mutation, and iterate for multiple generations. For 8-Queens: fitness = 1/(1+conflicts), tournament selection picks best of k random individuals, one-point crossover combines parent board segments, mutation randomly changes queen positions."
