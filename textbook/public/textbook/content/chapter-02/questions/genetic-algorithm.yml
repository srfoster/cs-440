  A genetic algorithm (GA) is a population-based optimization technique inspired by biological evolution. Candidates (called individuals) are evaluated by a fitness function, and new individuals are produced via selection, crossover (recombining "genes"), and mutation (random variation). This matters because GAs model an important AI strategy: exploit good solutions while exploring diverse alternatives, and they are useful when gradients or clean heuristics are unavailable.
  
  **Task:** Write pseudocode for GA_8QUEENS(popSize, generations, mutRate) including: a fitness function derived from conflicts, a selection method, crossover, mutation, and a main loop that returns a best board found.
answer: "Genetic algorithms maintain a population of candidate solutions, select parents based on fitness, create offspring through crossover and mutation, and iterate for multiple generations. For 8-Queens: fitness = 1/(1+conflicts), tournament selection picks best of k random individuals, one-point crossover combines parent board segments, mutation randomly changes queen positions."
