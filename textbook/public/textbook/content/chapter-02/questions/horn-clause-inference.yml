  **Implement inference for Horn clauses using forward chaining, backward chaining, and search-based methods.**

  **Level 0** Discuss Horn clauses as a restricted but practical fragment of logic. Why are they computationally attractive? Compare three perspectives on inference: data-driven (forward), goal-driven (backward), and search-based (general). When is each approach preferable? Give real-world examples: expert systems, Prolog, production rules.

  **Level 1** Define Horn clauses: implications with at most one positive literal (B₁ ∧ B₂ ∧ ... ∧ Bₙ → H).
  
  **Forward Chaining:** Start from known facts, repeatedly apply rules whose premises are all satisfied, add conclusions to fact base. Give pseudocode for FORWARD_CHAIN(rules, facts, query). Demonstrate by hand on family relationships (parent rules → ancestor query).
  
  **Backward Chaining:** Start from query goal, find rules that conclude it, recursively prove premises. Track visited goals to avoid cycles. Give pseudocode for BACKWARD_CHAIN(rules, facts, goal, visited). Demonstrate on same example working backwards.
  
  **Inference as Search:** View inference as state-space search where states are sets of derived facts and actions are rule applications. Give pseudocode for PROOF_BFS(rules, facts, query) using BFS. Show how this generalizes both approaches.

  **Level 2** Implement all three methods for a knowledge base with family relationships or animal classification rules. Compare: Which derives more facts? Which is faster for single queries? Track nodes expanded in each approach.

  **Level 3** Prove soundness and completeness for all three methods on Horn clauses. Analyze complexity: forward chaining O(pn) where p=premises, n=facts; backward chaining can be more efficient for single queries. Discuss applications: forward in RETE algorithm (expert systems), backward in Prolog, search view connects to Chapter 1. Why doesn't forward chaining work well for queries with many irrelevant rules? When does backward chaining loop without visited tracking?
answer: "Forward chaining (data-driven): maintain fact base, repeatedly find rules with all premises satisfied, add conclusions. Backward chaining (goal-driven): start with query, recursively prove premises of rules that conclude it, track visited to avoid cycles. Search view: states = fact sets, actions = rule applications, BFS to goal. All three are sound and complete for Horn clauses. Forward best for deriving all consequences, backward efficient for single queries, search view unifies both perspectives."
