question: |
  **Implement a logic programming language (e.g. Prolog) in a programming language of your choice.**

  **Level 0** Discuss the significance of logic programming and how it differs from procedural programming. What are Horn clauses, and why are they significant?  What about forward chaining, backward chaining, and inference as search?  Define resolution and unification, and explain how they are used in logic programming.

  **Level 1**  Use Horn clauses to represent a simple knowledge base (e.g., family relationships).  Demonstrate forward chaining and backward chaining inference algorithms to answer queries about the knowledge base.  Show how resolution and unification works in your implementation.
  
  **Level 2** In a language of your choice, implement a logic programming language that supports Horn clauses, forward chaining, backward chaining, and resolution.  Include a simple REPL (read-eval-print loop) to allow users to input facts and rules, and query the knowledge base. 

  **Level 3** Analyze the complexity of your inference algorithms.  Discuss the trade-offs between forward chaining and backward chaining in terms of efficiency and use cases.  How does your implementation handle cycles in the knowledge base?  What optimizations could be made to improve performance? 
answer: "Forward chaining (data-driven): maintain fact base, repeatedly find rules with all premises satisfied, add conclusions. Backward chaining (goal-driven): start with query, recursively prove premises of rules that conclude it, track visited to avoid cycles. Search view: states = fact sets, actions = rule applications, BFS to goal. All three are sound and complete for Horn clauses. Forward best for deriving all consequences, backward efficient for single queries, search view unifies both perspectives."
