question: |
  **Implement simulated annealing for the 8-Queens problem.**
  
  **Level 0** Explain why randomness and accepting worse moves can help optimization. What real-world annealing process inspired this algorithm?
  
  **Level 1** Describe simulated annealing intuitively: how temperature controls the probability of accepting worse moves, and how cooling schedules work. Provide pseudocode.
  
  **Level 2** Implement simulated annealing with temperature schedule and probabilistic acceptance based on exp(-delta/T).
  
  **Level 3** Analyze convergence properties. Discuss the trade-off between exploration (high temperature) and exploitation (low temperature).
answer: "Simulated annealing accepts worse moves with probability exp(-delta/T) where delta is the increase in cost and T is temperature. Temperature decreases over time (T = alpha * T). This allows escaping local optima early while converging to good solutions as T approaches 0. Named after metallurgical annealing where controlled cooling produces strong crystal structures."
