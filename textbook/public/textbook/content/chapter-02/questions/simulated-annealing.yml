  Simulated annealing is a stochastic optimization method inspired by physical annealing in metallurgy. Unlike hill climbing, it sometimes accepts worse moves early on to escape local minima, controlled by a temperature parameter T. As T decreases according to a cooling schedule, the algorithm becomes less willing to accept worse moves. This matters because it's one of the cleanest illustrations of how adding randomness can turn a brittle greedy method into something far more robust.
  
  **Task:** Write pseudocode for SIM_ANNEAL(board, T0, alpha, steps) that selects random neighbors, always accepts improvements, sometimes accepts worse moves with probability exp(-delta/T), and updates temperature each step.
answer: "Simulated annealing accepts worse moves with probability exp(-delta/T) where delta is the increase in cost and T is temperature. Temperature decreases over time (T = alpha * T). This allows escaping local optima early while converging to good solutions as T approaches 0. Named after metallurgical annealing where controlled cooling produces strong crystal structures."
