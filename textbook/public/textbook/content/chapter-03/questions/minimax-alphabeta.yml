question: |
  **Implement Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning for game trees.**
  
  **Level 0** Why do we need special algorithms for games? How does adversarial search differ from single-agent search?
  
  **Level 1** Explain minimax: alternating MAX and MIN layers, utility propagation, and best move selection. Then explain alpha-beta pruning. Provide pseudocode.
  
  **Level 2** Implement minimax decision and alpha-beta pruning for tic-tac-toe or a simple game tree.
  
  **Level 3** Prove alpha-beta's correctness and analyze its complexity. Discuss move ordering's impact on pruning effectiveness.
answer: "Minimax computes optimal play by recursively evaluating MAX (maximizer's turn) and MIN (minimizer's turn) layers. Alpha-beta pruning eliminates branches that cannot affect the final decision by maintaining alpha (best MAX option) and beta (best MIN option) bounds. If beta ≤ alpha, remaining siblings can be pruned. Optimal move ordering achieves O(b^(d/2)) vs. O(b^d) for minimax."
