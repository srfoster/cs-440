  **Implement optimal adversarial search using Minimax and Alpha-Beta pruning.**

  **Level 0** Discuss the shift from single-agent search (Chapter 1) to adversarial search. Why does having an opponent fundamentally change the problem? What makes a game "zero-sum"? Why is "assume optimal opponent" a reasonable design choice?

  **Level 1** Describe the minimax algorithm for deterministic two-player zero-sum games. How do MAX and MIN nodes alternate? How does utility propagate up the tree? Give pseudocode for MINIMAX_DECISION(state, player) and recursive helpers MAX_VALUE and MIN_VALUE using TERMINAL, UTILITY, ACTIONS, and RESULT. Demonstrate by hand on a tic-tac-toe subtree.
  
  Then describe alpha-beta pruning. What do alpha and beta represent? When can we prune? Give pseudocode for ALPHABETA_DECISION with AB_MAX and AB_MIN. Demonstrate pruning by hand on a game tree.

  **Level 2** Implement both minimax and alpha-beta for tic-tac-toe or another simple game. Compare the number of nodes expanded. Test with different move orderings to see pruning effectiveness.

  **Level 3** Prove that alpha-beta returns the same value as minimax (correctness). Analyze complexity: minimax is O(b^d), but with optimal move ordering alpha-beta achieves O(b^(d/2)). Discuss why move ordering matters and strategies like killer moves, history heuristic, and iterative deepening. When do we need depth limits and evaluation functions?
answer: "Minimax computes optimal play by recursively evaluating MAX (maximizer's turn) and MIN (minimizer's turn) layers. Alpha-beta pruning eliminates branches that cannot affect the final decision by maintaining alpha (best MAX option) and beta (best MIN option) bounds. If beta ≤ alpha, remaining siblings can be pruned. Optimal move ordering achieves O(b^(d/2)) vs. O(b^d) for minimax."
