  When the game tree is too large for exact minimax—even with alpha–beta pruning—agents can use Monte Carlo simulation to estimate move quality. A rollout (playout) simulates a complete game to terminal using random (or heuristic) moves, and the outcomes are averaged to estimate expected utility. This matters because Monte Carlo ideas are central in modern game-playing systems (and more broadly in approximate planning under uncertainty).
  
  **Task:** Write pseudocode for MONTE_CARLO_MOVE(state, player, rolloutsPerMove) and RANDOM_PLAYOUT.
  
  **Level 1** Explain MCTS phases: selection, expansion, simulation (rollout), backpropagation. Describe how random playouts estimate move quality.
  
  **Level 2** Implement a simple Monte Carlo move selection using random rollouts.
  
  **Level 3** Discuss UCB1 formula, exploration-exploitation balance, and why MCTS excels in large branching factor games like Go.
answer: "Monte Carlo move selection evaluates each legal move by performing random playouts from the resulting state. For each move, run N simulations playing randomly until game end, record wins/losses, and choose the move with highest win rate. MCTS extends this with tree search, UCB selection, and incremental tree building."
