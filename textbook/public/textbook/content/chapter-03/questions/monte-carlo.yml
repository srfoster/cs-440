  **Use Monte Carlo Tree Search when exact minimax is intractable.**

  **Level 0** Discuss the limitations of minimax/alpha-beta for large games. Why is Go harder than Chess? How does Monte Carlo simulation provide an alternative to exhaustive search? What's the key insight: "playing randomly is informative"?

  **Level 1** Describe simple Monte Carlo move evaluation using random playouts. For each legal move, simulate N random games from the resulting position and track win rate. Give pseudocode for MONTE_CARLO_MOVE(state, player, rolloutsPerMove) and RANDOM_PLAYOUT(state, player). Demonstrate by hand with a simple game.
  
  Then describe full MCTS with four phases: **Selection** (traverse tree using UCB), **Expansion** (add new node), **Simulation** (random playout), **Backpropagation** (update statistics). Explain the UCB1 formula: score = wins/visits + C * sqrt(ln(parent_visits)/visits).

  **Level 2** Implement simple Monte Carlo move selection with random rollouts for tic-tac-toe or connect-four. Then implement full MCTS with UCB selection. Compare performance and number of simulations needed.

  **Level 3** Analyze the exploration-exploitation trade-off in UCB1. Prove that UCB converges to optimal move selection with enough samples. Discuss why MCTS excels in high-branching games (Go has b≈250 vs Chess b≈35). Compare MCTS with alpha-beta: when is each preferable? Discuss neural network enhancements (AlphaGo).
answer: "Monte Carlo move selection evaluates each legal move by performing random playouts from the resulting state. For each move, run N simulations playing randomly until game end, record wins/losses, and choose the move with highest win rate. MCTS extends this with tree search, UCB selection, and incremental tree building."
