  **Find pure Nash equilibria in a 2×2 game.**
  
  Given payoff matrices A (row player) and B (col player), find all pure Nash equilibria.
answer: |
  A pure Nash equilibrium is a strategy profile where no player can improve their payoff by unilaterally changing strategy. Check each strategy pair (i,j) to see if it's a best response for both players.
  
  Pseudocode:
  ```
  function PURE_NASH_2x2(A, B):
      equilibria = []
      for i in 0..1:          # row action
          for j in 0..1:      # col action
              # is (i,j) best response for row?
              rowBest = true
              for i2 in 0..1:
                  if A[i2][j] > A[i][j]:
                      rowBest = false
              # is (i,j) best response for col?
              colBest = true
              for j2 in 0..1:
                  if B[i][j2] > B[i][j]:
                      colBest = false
              if rowBest and colBest:
                  add (i,j) to equilibria
      return equilibria
  ```
