  Arc consistency enforces a local constraint property: for every value in a variable's domain, there must exist a compatible value in each neighbor's domain (for the constraint between them). The AC-3 algorithm repeatedly applies a REVISE step across arcs until no more pruning is possible. This matters because it's a canonical inference algorithm and a building block for more advanced CSP solvers; it can dramatically shrink domains before or during search.
  
  **Task:** Write pseudocode for AC3(csp) and REVISE(csp,X,Y).
  
  **Level 1** Explain arc consistency: when is an arc (X,Y) consistent? Describe the AC-3 algorithm with queue of arcs. Provide pseudocode.
  
  **Level 2** Implement AC-3 with the REVISE function for a specific constraint type (e.g., not-equal for map coloring).
  
  **Level 3** Analyze AC-3's time complexity O(n²d³) and its role as preprocessing. Discuss stronger consistency levels (path consistency, k-consistency).
answer: "AC-3 makes CSP arc-consistent: for every arc (X,Y), every value x in X's domain has some value y in Y's domain satisfying the constraint. Algorithm maintains queue of arcs, repeatedly calling REVISE(X,Y) which removes values from X's domain that have no supporting value in Y. When X's domain changes, add arcs (Z,X) back to queue. Returns false if any domain becomes empty."
