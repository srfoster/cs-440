  Backtracking search solves CSPs by assigning variables one at a time and undoing assignments when they lead to a dead end. Forward checking is an inference technique that prunes neighbor domains immediately after an assignment, detecting failures early. This matters because it demonstrates the key CSP theme: solving is not only "search," but "search + inference," and inference can produce orders-of-magnitude speedups.
  
  **Task:** Write pseudocode for BACKTRACK(assignment, csp) that includes forward checking and domain restoration on backtracking.
  
  **Level 1** Explain CSP components (variables, domains, constraints) and backtracking search. Describe forward checking. Provide pseudocode.
  
  **Level 2** Implement backtracking with forward checking for map coloring or Sudoku.
  
  **Level 3** Analyze heuristics: MRV (minimum remaining values), degree heuristic, least-constraining-value. Discuss time complexity improvements.
answer: "Backtracking search assigns variables one at a time, checking consistency at each step. Forward checking prunes future variable domains after each assignment by removing values that conflict with the assignment. When a domain becomes empty, backtrack. For map coloring with k colors and n regions: without inference O(k^n), with forward checking much faster in practice."
