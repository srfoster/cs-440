question: |
  **Implement cutset conditioning for CSPs.**
  
  Choose cutset variables, enumerate assignments, solve remaining as tree CSP.
answer: |
  Cutset conditioning works by instantiating a set of variables (cutset) such that removing them makes the constraint graph a tree. Then solve the tree CSP for each cutset assignment.
  
  Pseudocode:
  ```
  function CUTSET_CONDITIONING(csp, cutsetVars):
      for cutAssign in ALL_ASSIGNMENTS(cutsetVars, csp.dom):
          csp2 = COPY_CSP(csp)
          if not APPLY_ASSIGNMENT(csp2, cutAssign): continue
          if not AC3(csp2): continue
          
          # assume removing cutset makes graph a tree
          root = any var not in cutsetVars
          sol = TREE_CSP_SOLVE(csp2, root)
          if sol != failure:
              return MERGE(sol, cutAssign)
      return failure
  ```
