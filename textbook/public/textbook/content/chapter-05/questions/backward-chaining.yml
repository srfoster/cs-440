question: |
  **Implement backward chaining for Horn clauses (goal-driven reasoning).**
  
  Write BACKWARD_CHAIN(rules, facts, goal, visited).
answer: |
  Backward chaining starts with a goal and works backwards, trying to prove premises of rules that conclude the goal. It's goal-driven and efficient for answering single queries.
  
  Pseudocode:
  ```
  function BACKWARD_CHAIN(rules, facts, goal, visited):
      if goal in facts: return true
      if goal in visited: return false
      visited.add(goal)
      
      for r in rules where r.conclusion == goal:
          ok = true
          for prem in r.premises:
              if not BACKWARD_CHAIN(rules, facts, prem, visited):
                  ok = false
                  break
          if ok: return true
      return false
  ```
