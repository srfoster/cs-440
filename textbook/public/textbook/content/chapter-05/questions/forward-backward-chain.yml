question: |
  **Implement forward and backward chaining for Horn clauses.**
  
  **Level 0** Compare data-driven vs. goal-driven reasoning. When is each approach preferable?
  
  **Level 1** Explain forward chaining (start from facts, apply rules forward) and backward chaining (start from query, work backwards). Provide pseudocode for both.
  
  **Level 2** Implement both algorithms for a simple Horn clause knowledge base.
  
  **Level 3** Analyze completeness, soundness, and complexity. Discuss applications in expert systems and Prolog.
answer: "Forward chaining: maintain agenda of known facts, repeatedly select a fact, find rules whose premises are satisfied, add conclusions to agenda. Stops when query is derived or agenda empties. Backward chaining: start with query goal, find rules that conclude it, recursively prove premises. Both are sound and complete for Horn clauses. Forward chaining is data-driven (good for many queries), backward is goal-driven (efficient for single query)."
