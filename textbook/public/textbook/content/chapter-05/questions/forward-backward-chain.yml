  Forward chaining is a data-driven inference method for Horn clauses: starting from known facts, repeatedly apply rules whose premises are satisfied to derive new facts. Backward chaining is a goal-driven inference method: start with a query (goal) and work backward by finding rules that could conclude it, recursively trying to prove their premises. Forward chaining matters because it models rule-based expert systems and production systems, and demonstrates a clear form of inference that can be efficient when there are many facts and you want all consequences. Backward chaining matters because it resembles how humans often reason ("to prove this, what would need to be true?") and because it is efficient when you only care about a specific query rather than all consequences.
  
  **Task:** Write pseudocode for FORWARD_CHAIN(rules, facts, query) that returns whether the query is derivable. Also write pseudocode for BACKWARD_CHAIN(rules, facts, goal, visited) that avoids cycles.
  
  **Level 0** Compare data-driven vs. goal-driven reasoning. When is each approach preferable?
  
  **Level 1** Explain forward chaining (start from facts, apply rules forward) and backward chaining (start from query, work backwards). Provide pseudocode for both.
  
  **Level 2** Implement both algorithms for a simple Horn clause knowledge base.
  
  **Level 3** Analyze completeness, soundness, and complexity. Discuss applications in expert systems and Prolog.
answer: "Forward chaining: maintain agenda of known facts, repeatedly select a fact, find rules whose premises are satisfied, add conclusions to agenda. Stops when query is derived or agenda empties. Backward chaining: start with query goal, find rules that conclude it, recursively prove premises. Both are sound and complete for Horn clauses. Forward chaining is data-driven (good for many queries), backward is goal-driven (efficient for single query)."
