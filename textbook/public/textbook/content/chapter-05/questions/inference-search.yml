question: |
  Many inference systems can be understood as search: you explore a space of derived statements by repeatedly applying inference rules. This viewpoint matters because it connects symbolic reasoning to the earlier parts of AI (search), clarifying that the difference is often the representation and operators, not the "shape" of the computation.
  
  **Task:** Write pseudocode for PROOF_BFS(rules, facts, query) that derives new facts by applying rules and returns whether the query is reachable.
  
  Write PROOF_BFS(rules, facts, query) that treats proof search as state-space search.
answer: |
  Inference can be formulated as a search problem where states are sets of derived facts, actions are rule applications, and the goal is deriving the query.
  
  Pseudocode:
  ```
  function PROOF_BFS(rules, facts, query):
      frontier = queue()
      visitedFacts = set(facts)
      frontier.enqueue(facts)
      
      while not frontier.isEmpty():
          currentFacts = frontier.dequeue()
          if query in currentFacts: return true
          
          for r in rules:
              if all prem in currentFacts:
                  nextFacts = currentFacts ∪ {r.conclusion}
                  if r.conclusion not in visitedFacts:
                      visitedFacts.add(r.conclusion)
                      frontier.enqueue(nextFacts)
      return false
  ```
