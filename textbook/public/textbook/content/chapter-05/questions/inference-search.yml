question: |
  **Implement inference as BFS over derived facts.**
  
  Write PROOF_BFS(rules, facts, query) that treats proof search as state-space search.
answer: |
  Inference can be formulated as a search problem where states are sets of derived facts, actions are rule applications, and the goal is deriving the query.
  
  Pseudocode:
  ```
  function PROOF_BFS(rules, facts, query):
      frontier = queue()
      visitedFacts = set(facts)
      frontier.enqueue(facts)
      
      while not frontier.isEmpty():
          currentFacts = frontier.dequeue()
          if query in currentFacts: return true
          
          for r in rules:
              if all prem in currentFacts:
                  nextFacts = currentFacts ∪ {r.conclusion}
                  if r.conclusion not in visitedFacts:
                      visitedFacts.add(r.conclusion)
                      frontier.enqueue(nextFacts)
      return false
  ```
