question: |
  Resolution is a single, sound inference rule that can be used (with CNF conversion) to perform refutation proof: to show that a knowledge base entails a query, add the negation of the query and derive a contradiction (the empty clause). This matters because it is one of the most important completeness results in automated reasoning: a simple mechanical rule can, in principle, prove any propositional entailment.
  
  **Task:** Write pseudocode for RESOLUTION_ENTAILS(KB_clauses, q).
answer: |
  Resolution theorem proving works by converting KB ∪ {¬q} to CNF and repeatedly resolving pairs of clauses. If the empty clause is derived, KB ⊨ q.
  
  Pseudocode:
  ```
  function RESOLUTION_ENTAILS(KB_clauses, q):
      clauses = set(KB_clauses ∪ CNF(¬q))
      new = set()
      
      while true:
          pairs = ALL_PAIRS(clauses)
          for (c1,c2) in pairs:
              resolvents = RESOLVE(c1,c2)
              if {} in resolvents: return true      # empty clause
              new = new ∪ resolvents
          if new ⊆ clauses: return false
          clauses = clauses ∪ new
  ```
