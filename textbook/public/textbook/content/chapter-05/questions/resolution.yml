question: |
  **Implement resolution for propositional logic.**
  
  Prove KB ⊨ q by refutation using resolution.
answer: |
  Resolution theorem proving works by converting KB ∪ {¬q} to CNF and repeatedly resolving pairs of clauses. If the empty clause is derived, KB ⊨ q.
  
  Pseudocode:
  ```
  function RESOLUTION_ENTAILS(KB_clauses, q):
      clauses = set(KB_clauses ∪ CNF(¬q))
      new = set()
      
      while true:
          pairs = ALL_PAIRS(clauses)
          for (c1,c2) in pairs:
              resolvents = RESOLVE(c1,c2)
              if {} in resolvents: return true      # empty clause
              new = new ∪ resolvents
          if new ⊆ clauses: return false
          clauses = clauses ∪ new
  ```
