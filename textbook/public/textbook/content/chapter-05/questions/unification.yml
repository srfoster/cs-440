question: |
  **Implement the unification algorithm for first-order logic.**
  
  **Level 0** Why is pattern matching essential for logical inference? How does unification enable theorem proving?
  
  **Level 1** Explain unification: finding substitutions that make expressions identical. Handle variables, constants, and functions. Provide pseudocode.
  
  **Level 2** Implement UNIFY(x, y, subst) with occurs check to prevent infinite structures.
  
  **Level 3** Discuss unification's role in resolution, Prolog, and type inference. Analyze time complexity and most general unifiers (MGU).
answer: "Unification finds substitutions θ such that SUBST(θ, x) = SUBST(θ, y). Algorithm recursively processes terms: if both are identical, success; if one is a variable, extend substitution; if both are functions with same name/arity, unify arguments pairwise. Occurs check prevents X from unifying with f(X). Returns most general unifier or failure."
