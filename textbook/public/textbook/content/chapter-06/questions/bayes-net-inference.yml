  A Bayesian network is a directed acyclic graph where nodes are random variables and edges represent direct probabilistic dependencies. It compactly represents a joint distribution using conditional probability tables (CPTs) and conditional independence structure. Exact inference answers queries like P(X∣e) by summing out hidden variables, but can be expensive. This matters because Bayes nets are the canonical model for probabilistic reasoning, and enumeration shows the "ground truth" algorithm against which approximations are compared.
  
  **Task:** Write pseudocode for ENUM_ASK(X, e, bn) and ENUM_ALL(vars, e, bn).
  
  **Level 0** Why model uncertainty with probability? How do Bayesian networks compactly represent joint distributions?
  
  **Level 1** Explain Bayes nets: nodes as variables, edges as dependencies, CPTs (conditional probability tables). Describe enumeration algorithm for computing P(X|e). Provide pseudocode.
  
  **Level 2** Implement ENUM_ASK and ENUM_ALL for a simple Bayesian network.
  
  **Level 3** Discuss computational complexity, variable elimination improvements, and approximate inference (likelihood weighting, MCMC).
answer: "Enumeration computes P(X|e) by summing joint probabilities over all possible values of hidden variables. ENUM_ASK normalizes the distribution. ENUM_ALL recursively multiplies CPT entries: if variable is observed, use its value; otherwise sum over all possible values. Time complexity exponential in number of variables, but variable elimination reduces it to exponential in tree-width."
