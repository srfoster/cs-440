  A Hidden Markov Model (HMM) represents a system with a hidden state that evolves over time according to a Markov transition model, while producing noisy observations. Filtering computes the belief distribution over the current hidden state given all observations so far. This matters because it's the prototypical "reasoning over time" model, used in tracking, speech, robotics, and many sequential inference tasks.
  
  **Task:** Write pseudocode for HMM_FILTER(priorBelief, observations, T, O) that performs repeated predict–update–normalize steps.
  
  **Level 0** Why model temporal processes with HMMs? What is the filtering task?
  
  **Level 1** Explain HMM components: states, transition model, observation model. Describe filtering: computing P(X_t|e_{1:t}). Provide the recursive forward algorithm.
  
  **Level 2** Implement HMM filtering with belief update using transition and observation matrices.
  
  **Level 3** Discuss Viterbi algorithm for most likely sequence, particle filtering for non-linear models, and applications in speech/robotics.
answer: "HMM filtering maintains belief state over hidden variables. Forward algorithm: belief_{t} = α * O_t * T^T * belief_{t-1}, where T is transition matrix, O_t is observation matrix (diagonal), α normalizes. This is a Bayesian update: prediction (apply transition) then correction (incorporate observation). Time O(n²) per step for n states."
