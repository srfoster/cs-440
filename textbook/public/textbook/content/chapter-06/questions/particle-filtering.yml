question: |
  **Implement particle filtering for dynamic Bayesian networks.**
  
  Write PARTICLE_FILTER with propagate, weight, and resample steps.
answer: |
  Particle filtering approximates belief distributions using weighted samples (particles). Each step: propagate particles through transition model, weight by observation likelihood, resample based on weights.
  
  Pseudocode:
  ```
  function PARTICLE_FILTER(particles, observation, TRANSITION, OBS_LIK, N):
      # 1) propagate
      for i in 1..N:
          particles[i] = TRANSITION(particles[i])
      
      # 2) weight by observation likelihood
      weights = []
      for i in 1..N:
          weights[i] = OBS_LIK(observation, particles[i])
      
      # 3) resample
      particles = RESAMPLE(particles, weights, N)
      return particles
  ```
