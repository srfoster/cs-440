question: |
  When the state space is large or continuous, exact HMM/DBN inference becomes infeasible. Particle filtering approximates the belief state with a set of weighted samples (particles) that are propagated through the dynamics and reweighted by observation likelihood, then resampled. This matters because particle filtering is a standard practical algorithm for robotics and tracking, and it cleanly illustrates approximate inference as "simulation + correction."
  
  **Task:** Write pseudocode for PARTICLE_FILTER(particles, observation, TRANSITION, OBS_LIK, N) including propagation, weighting, and resampling.
  
  Write PARTICLE_FILTER with propagate, weight, and resample steps.
answer: |
  Particle filtering approximates belief distributions using weighted samples (particles). Each step: propagate particles through transition model, weight by observation likelihood, resample based on weights.
  
  Pseudocode:
  ```
  function PARTICLE_FILTER(particles, observation, TRANSITION, OBS_LIK, N):
      # 1) propagate
      for i in 1..N:
          particles[i] = TRANSITION(particles[i])
      
      # 2) weight by observation likelihood
      weights = []
      for i in 1..N:
          weights[i] = OBS_LIK(observation, particles[i])
      
      # 3) resample
      particles = RESAMPLE(particles, weights, N)
      return particles
  ```
