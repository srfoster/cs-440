question: |
  **Implement a single 2D convolution forward pass (no padding, stride 1).**
  
  Write CONV2D(image, kernel).
answer: |
  Convolution is a fundamental operation in CNNs that applies a filter (kernel) across an image to detect features. The kernel slides over the image, computing dot products at each position.
  
  Pseudocode:
  ```
  function CONV2D(image, kernel):
      H = image.height; W = image.width
      kH = kernel.height; kW = kernel.width
      outH = H - kH + 1
      outW = W - kW + 1
      out = matrix(outH, outW, 0)
      
      for i in 0..outH-1:
          for j in 0..outW-1:
              s = 0
              for a in 0..kH-1:
                  for b in 0..kW-1:
                      s += image[i+a][j+b] * kernel[a][b]
              out[i][j] = s
      return out
  ```
